# Introduction

Welcome to The Refactoring Tales, a book that documents some of the refactorings and changes I've made in recent (and mostly real-life) projects. This book isn't going to teach you about language constructs, conditionals, functions, or so on, but hopefully offer insight into how to take steps to make your code more readable and more importantly, maintainable.

Think of how much time you spend maintaining code, rather than being able to write code from scratch. Day to day, I'm not typically creating new projects, but I am maintaining, editing or refactoring existing projects. This book is just like that. Each chapter will start by looking at some existing code, and over the course of a few pages we will examine, disect and then refactor the code into an improved alternative. Of course, the idea of code being "better" is largely subjective, but even if you don't quite agree with every step I take, you should be able to see the overall benefits.

The GitHub repository for this book is here: https://github.com/jackfranklin/the-refactoring-tales, both the raw book files and the code samples are all there for you to take. If you spot any issues as you read this book, a new issue (or even better, a pull request!) is greatly appreciated.
